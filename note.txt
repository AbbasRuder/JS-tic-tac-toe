//CSS

--mark--
cross or circle class on the the cell elements('cell') will show that mark on that cell.

--hover--
cross or circle class on the the parent element('board') will show that mark on hover of every cell.

--result message & restart btn--
default is 'display:none'. Can be changed to 'display:flex' by adding a `show` class on the parent div ('winning-message')



//JS

1. Add `click` eventListener to all the cells and add 'once' option to make them fire only once.

2. In handleClick, add the class of mark (cross'X' or circle'O' based on whose turn it is) to the clicked cell.

	if there's a winner, show the winner page with the winner's mark(X or O)

	if draw, show that match is draw

	Else change the turn and call hover fn (adds the current-mark class on the 'board' element(the parent to the 'cell') to show the mark on hover.)

3. On restart, all the added class and the event on cell should be removed
